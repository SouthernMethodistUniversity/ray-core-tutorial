Introduction to Ray Core Design Patterns and APIs.

This is an introduction to basic Ray patterns for distributing computing. This tutorial will cover at least three basic Ray patterns
and its respective Ray Core APIs. By no means all the Ray patterns are covered here. We recommend that you follow the references
for advanced patterns if you want to use Ray to write your own ML-based libraries or want to take existing Python single-process or
single-node multi-core applications and covert them into distributed multi-core, multi-node processes on a Ray cluster.

### Instructions to get started

We assume that you have a `conda` installed.

 1. `conda create -f environment.yml`
 2. `conda activate ray-core`
 3. `git clone git@github.com:dmatrix/ray-core-tutorial.git`
 4. `cd` to <clone_dir>`
 5. `jupyter lab`
 
 Enjoy Ray!
