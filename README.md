# Introduction to Ray Core Design Patterns and APIs.

<img src="images/ray-logo.png" height="50%" width="50%">


This is an introduction to basic Ray patterns for distributing computing. This tutorial will cover at least three basic Ray patterns
and its respective Ray Core APIs. By no means all the Ray patterns are covered here. We recommend that you follow the references
for advanced patterns if you want to use Ray to write your own ML-based libraries or want to take existing Python single-process or
single-node multi-core applications and covert them into distributed multi-core, multi-node processes on a Ray cluster.

Knowing these Ray patterns and anti-patterns will guide you in writing effective and robust distributed applications 
using the Ray framework and its proper usage of Ray APIs.

### Instructions to get started

We assume that you have a `conda` installed.

 1. `source env.sh ray-core 3.8.10` 
 3. `git clone git@github.com:dmatrix/ray-core-tutorial.git`
 4. `cd` to `<cloned_dir>`
 5. `jupyter lab`
 
 Enjoy Ray!
