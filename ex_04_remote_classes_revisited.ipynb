    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Ray has a myriad of design patterns for [tasks](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-core/tasks/patterns/index.html#task-patterns) and [actors](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-core/actors/patterns/index.html). These patterns\n",
    "allows you to write distributed applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tree of Actors Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "A common pattern used in Ray libraries [Ray Tune](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/tune/index.html), [Ray Train](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/train/train.html), and [RLlib](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/rllib/index.html) to train models in a parallel or conduct distributed HPO.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this common pattern, tree of actors, a collection of workers as actors, are managed by a supervisor actor. For example, you want to train multiple models, each of a different type, at the same time, while being able to inspect its state during its training.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/_images/tree-of-actors.svg\" width=\"25%\" height=\"25%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern is no different from Same Data Different Function/Model (SDDF). Popular in AutoML scenarios, where you may want to train different models at the same time using the same dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/same_data_different_model.png\" width=\"35%\" height=\"25%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning objectives\n",
    "In this this tutorial, we revisit Ray Actors and learn more about:\n",
    " * Common Ray Actors patterns used in Ray native libraries for writing distributed Actors\n",
    "   * Tree of Actors \n",
    "   * Same Data Different Functions (SDDF)\n",
    " * How to use Actors for Batch Inference\n",
    " * How to pass Ray Actors to remote tasks for distributed computing\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's implement a simple example to illustrate this pattern."
