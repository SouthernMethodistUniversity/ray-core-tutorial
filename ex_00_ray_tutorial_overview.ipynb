    "## About This Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we cover the basic Ray Core APIs and its fundamental patterns. This is an introductory material. We cover three basic distributed Ray core APIs patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Remote Functions as Tasks\n",
    " * Remote Objects as Futures\n",
    " * Remote Classes as stateful Actors\n",
    " \n",

    " \n",
    "There are other advance [Ray Patterns and Anti-patterns](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-design-patterns/index.html), which are not covered in this tutorial. Mainly applicable when writing more complex distributed applications, we recommend reading themo \n",
    "to equip yourself to use Ray APIs more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we also introduce [XGBoost-Ray](https://github.com/ray-project/xgboost_ray), a drop-in replacement for XGBoost that allows you to do distributed HPO.\n",
