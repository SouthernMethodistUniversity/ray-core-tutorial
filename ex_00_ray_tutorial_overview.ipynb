    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we cover the basic Ray Core APIs and its fundamental patterns. This is an introductory material. We cover three basic distributed Ray core APIs patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Remote Functions as Tasks\n",
    " * Remote Objects as Futures\n",
    " * Remote Classes as stateful Actors\n",

    "There are other advance [Ray Patterns and Anti-patterns](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-design-patterns/index.html), which are not covered in this tutorial \n",
    "Mainly applicable when writing more complex distributed applications, we recommend reading themo \n",
    "to equip yourself to use Ray APIs more effectively.\n",
